                    I am an aspiring Fullstack Developer with a background in Human Resources and Business Administration. My history with technology
                    goes back to a time when floppy disks were the thing. As a child, I used to build, and erm… destroy,
                    my own desktops. I didn’t shy away from trying a new component, or a new trick to overclock my CPU to
                    the limit. My passion now is in web and application development as a new career path to put my passion
                    and my career together. I worked as Recruitment Consultant for over eight years. Throughout my career,
                    I supported large international organizations in Canada and abroad. In my free time, you will find me
                    riding my motorcycle, playing soccer or trying a new restaurant in Toronto…. That’s in the summer though.
                    In the winter, I will be doing the same things, but driving.
                </P>

                <P>
                    Please feel free to browse around my portfolio. There is nothing in it yet, except for a few pictures I didn't even take.
                    It is a matter of time, though, before the portfolio page becomes busy. Also don't forget to drop me
                    a not to say that you were here. I may not get your message though as the submit button doesn't work
                    yet (no JavaScript). As I said, it is just a matter of time.
